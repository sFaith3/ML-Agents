# Input Output. Delivery One

<img src="../docs/images/image-banner.png" align="middle" width="3000"/>

## Introduction 

This first delivery of the input/output course at ENTI delivered during Spring 2020 is focused on showing you understood the basic notions of modern machine learning, and how to use such techniques as they are available in Unity. Your goal is to analyze  one of the basic examples, dissect it, understand it, and apply the same strategy to a different problem.

## Assets 

The assets to explore and use are the ones available at the ml-agents repository, which for this course I have forked [here]( https://github.com/joanllobera/ml-agents.git). It is also possible to add examples from the Marathon environmetns, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/marathon-envs)

## Delivery format 

You must deliver a notebook reflecting the exercises outlined below. You will also be asked to go through your notebook in class, explaining to the rest  of the class what you did, and how to reproduce your results.

A complementary scene or example implemented may also be included in the delivery.



## Exercises 

The notebook will have the following sections:
1. **Introduction**
A short paragraph explaining what is the aim of this notebook, and a specification of the team involved (at least: picture, name, surname, email)

2. **Case analysis** 
You explain clearly how an example that is already implemented works. This includes at least an explanation of:
 a) what are the rewards, 
 b) what are the states, 
 c) how is, in general, the training implemented 

3. **Performance analysis** 
You do a performance analysis of the training using TensorBoard, exploring what parameters are most critical to a) make it work, b) produce smooth results, and c) train fast. In your analysis you should include a combination of parameters that does not work, and some that do work. You should also show some understanding of the role of the parameters, and try to explain why something works or doesn't.

4. **New case proposal** 
Taking as basis the example analysed, you propose, implement and test a different task for the same training procedure, or a very similar one. You explain how to train the new use case, and how the setup, rewards, states or training changed, compared to the example. 


5. **Team**
A table with your names, recent picture and enti emails

## Grades

The grades will follow these guidelines:
1. Quality of documentation and class presentation (+1)
2. Case analysis (+3)
3. Performance analysis (+2)
4. New case proposal (+4)

## Extra requirements

* The notebook and code that you propose should be in folder delivery1, and work straight away from downloading the repository. 
* Your username should reflect your name+surname, and all your commits should be associated with your ENTI email
* Your delivery should have a tag labelled `ENTI_IO2020_D1_GXX`, where *XX* stands for your group number
* Your repository contributions should follow the git flow conventions. You should work on one or several  separate branches, and perform a merge  once satisfied with your contribution. The branch to which you will want to merge is called `develop-ENTI`
* The files should be organized preserving the structure already set up in the repository
* Your contributions should not collide with the ones from other development teams

**All the extra requirements should be satisfied for the submission to be evaluated.**
